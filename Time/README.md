# Time

1. Display the current time
2. Display the current time in New York
3. Ask the user to enter a time and display the difference in minutes between that time and the current time.
4. Ask the user to enter a time and display it as words – for example:
    * 11:40 displays as “20 minutes to 11 in the morning”
    * 15:23 displays as “23 minutes past 3 in the afternoon”
    * 16:00 displays as “4 o’clock in the afternoon”
    * Continue to add other terms like “half past”, “quarter to”, “midnight”
5. Extend Q4 to convert all numbers to words and display responses as sentences -for example: “The time is twenty three minutes past midnight.”
6. Extend Q5 by rounding to the nearest 5 mins and using “almost”, “just after” and “exactly” where appropriate – for example “The time is just after quarter past ten in the morning.”
7. Find a Python text-to-speech package and extend Q6 to create a speaking clock.
