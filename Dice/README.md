# Dice Challenge

1. How many times will you have to roll 5 dice before you get 5 sixes?
    - Write a function called roll_dice that returns a random number between 1 and 6.
    - Write another function call roll_five_dice that uses this function to roll 5 dice and return them in a list.
    - Write a third function called check_for_sixes that checks the list of 5 numbers to see if they are all sixes.
    - Use these functions to count how many times you need to roll 5 dice before you get all sixes. Display your answer.
    - Run your programme several times. Did you get the same answer each time? Why?
2. Modify your code so that it asks the user how many dice to throw each time. Count how many throws it takes to get all sixes.
> Note: If you enter a large number of dice (7 or more), it will take a very long time to run your code. To stop you code running, hit Ctrl-C or click on Interrupt Execution in the Shell menu.
