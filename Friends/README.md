# Friends

1: Write the following program using Python:
    - Ask the user to enter the names of 3 friends.
    - Save the friends’ names in a list variable.
    - Print the list of friends’ names.
2. Update the program so that it keeps asking for names until the user enters a blank name.
3. Update the program so that it prints the longest name.
4. Update the program so that it sorts the list of names alphabetically and prints the first 3 names in the list.
5. Update the program so that the sorted names are printed on separate lines preceded by their rank. So print “1” before the first item, “2” before the second and so on.
